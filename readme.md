# Facebook Feed Limiter :newspaper:

Have you ever lost 4 hours scrolling through your Facebook news feed? :clock4: There's a reason they call it *infinite* scroll.

This magnificent Chrome extension limits it to 10 items, which is something you secretly always wanted. This only limits the **news** feed, not the feed of a specific profile or a custom feed.

This extension consists of 5 lines of CSS based on the current markup on Facebook, which will occasionally change, but I'll do my best to catch up with the changes.

If there's a more stable way to achieve this, please let me know.
