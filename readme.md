# Facebook Feed Limiter :newspaper:

Have you ever lost 4 hours scrolling through your Facebook news feed? :clock4: There's a reason they call it *infinite* scroll.

This magnificent Chrome extension limits it to roughly a dozen items, which is something you secretly always wanted. This only limits the **news** feed, not the feed of a specific profile or a custom feed.

It's just a few lines of CSS. Facebook will desperately try to load new content when you reach the last one, but it won't be able to show it :smiling_imp:

## TODO

  - reliably show a fixed number of items (currently the number varies)
